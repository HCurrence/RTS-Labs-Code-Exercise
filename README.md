#1  Print the number of integers in an array that are above the given input and the number that are below, e.g. for the array [1, 5, 2, 1, 10] with input 6, print “above: 1, below: 4”.

#2  Rotate the characters in a string by a given input and have the overflow appear at the beginning, e.g. “MyString” rotated by 2 is “ngMyStri”.

#3  If you could change 1 thing about your favorite framework/language/platform (pick one), what would it be?

I appreciate languages with static data types. It is easier for me to read and understand someone else's code when the variables are cut-and-dry; however, I do also appreciate having the choice of runtime data typing when programming as well. Runtime data typing makes the program easier to write - which makes ideas easier to implement. So, while Java is my first true love, I would advocate for the option of runtime data typing. (I may be inadvertantly talking about Javascript or C though.)
